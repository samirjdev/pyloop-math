## Introducing Pyloop Math, originally known as Pyloop Addition!

Pyloop Math was created as part of a project for a science class a while ago. Pyloop Math showcases basic skill of python coding/syntax. 

To start, choose between addition and subtraction, and then in a particular time limit, see how fast you can go through basic math and test your speed! At the end, there will be detailed statistics based on your results such as how long you took, what you got wrong, what you got right, and an overall percentage score. Try to beat your high score!

## Setup
